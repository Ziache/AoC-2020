# Advent of Code 2020

Hello everyone,
In this repository you will find the code I wrote for Eric Wastl's Advent of Code, 2020 edition.

The language I use is Python, and all the files are provided with comments.

For each day, I will provide two files, one for each part of the puzzle.

Let me know if you have any suggestions on how the code could be improved, I am still a junior programmer so I guess I still have a lot to learn.
